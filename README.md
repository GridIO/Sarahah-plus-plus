# Sarahah-plus-plus

This is an open-source version of Sarahah. *with add-ons* 

I figured out people are taking benefits of being anonymous and submitting distractful, abusing and inappropriate content many times while using Sarahah. A friend of mine got lots of abusive comments rather than constructive views. So I made this; Sarahah++ 

This tool performs sentimental analysis on anonymous message; if any disrespectful/ cheap/ vulgar comments found it just delete it and warn the anonymous user. Only good constructive messages survive from this and make a way to end user. 

Tweet me @neelkadia I would love to see what's your view on this.
